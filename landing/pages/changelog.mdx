# Changelog

## 0.0.5 - 22 / 09 / 2022

- Query Language. Now you can find resources by service type and region using following syntax: `> service:ec2 region:eu-west-1`. You can also use `reg` or `r` as an alias for `region`, and `svc` or `s` as an alias for `service`.
- Improvements to the tokenizer yielding better search results
- Boosted resource type importance in the search results. For example, when looking for a `lambda`, Functions will always come first in the results despite not having the word `lambda` in their name whereas log groups having that name (e.g. `/aws/lambda/lambda-name`) will be ranked lower.
- AWS Service search has been moved to the service worker and capped to 10 best results.
- Added styled scrollbar
