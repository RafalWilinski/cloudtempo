Firing these requests requires having a valid CSRF token. CSRF token is embedded on home pages of respective services.
It is impossible to get them reliably using fetch because of noscript. instead of firing a get,
a full browser navigation event should be performed to these pages (which will also perform a fully fledged auth).
This can be done (theories):
- By using an IFrame but AWS Console detects this and blocks it. Maybe we can get rid of this header by intercepting the request?
